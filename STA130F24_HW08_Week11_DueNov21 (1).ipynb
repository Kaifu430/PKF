    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "First Confusion Matrix (Model clf):\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses only List Price as a feature to predict whether the book is Hardcover or Paperback.\n",
    "Since this model is trained using a single feature (List Price), its decision boundaries are likely simpler and may not capture all the complexities of the data.\n",
    "This model might have more false positives or false negatives because the single feature might not provide enough information to make accurate predictions for all cases.\n",
    "Second Confusion Matrix (Model clf2):\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses multiple features: NumPages, Thick, and List Price.\n",
    "By incorporating more features, clf2 has a better chance of distinguishing between hardcover and paperback books, leading to a more accurate classification.\n",
    "This model might show fewer false positives and false negatives, since the additional features provide more detailed context for predictions.\n",
    "Why clf2 is Better:\n",
    "More Features: By incorporating more features, such as the number of pages and thickness, clf2 can better differentiate between the two classes (hardcover vs. paperback).\n",
    "Improved Accuracy: The additional features allow the model to create more refined decision boundaries, reducing misclassification errors (false positives and false negatives).\n",
    "In conclusion, the difference in performance is caused by the amount and quality of the input data — the more relevant features the model uses, the better it can learn to make accurate predictions."

Thus overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new **decision node splitting rule**, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the improvement contributions attributed to the **feature** upon which the **decision node splitting rule** is based.  This means the relative contribution of each **predictor variable** to the overall explanatory power of the model can be calculated, and this is what the `.feature_importances_` attribute does. \n",

But the so-called **feature importance** heuristics allows us to judge how relatively important the overall contributions from different features are in the final decision tree predictions. Now we just need to be sure we're not **overfitting** our **classification decision trees** since they can be so **complex**. Fortunately, the \"GridSearchCV\" methodology mentioned in regards to finding the best `max_depth` setting for a tree is going to provide a general answer to the challenge of complexity and **overfitting** in **machine learning models** that is not too hard to understand (and which you might already have some guesses or a hunch about). \n",
