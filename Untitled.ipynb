    "There is an e-commerce company and I want to study what factors affect the total amount of money customers spend in a specific year. We can investigate the relationship between average session length, time spent in the app and time spent on the website, and how much customers spend per year. This can give us an idea of whether longer interaction time means higher consumption. We can also estimate average annual spend Estimating average annual spend across all customers can provide insight into overall customer value. I am also interested in the relationship between time spent using an app and the amount spent per year."

I plan to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation to understand spendina patternsand analyze the distribution to identify any outliers or trends. Finally, customers were segmented based onspending levels to examine different behaviors. This variable is a direct measure of customer value andprofitability. It helps identify high-value customers and provide better recommendations to customers.I can use a histogram, a visualization that shows the distribution of annual spending, to be able to quickly seethe shape ot the distribution and whether there are any outliers. I can also use boxplots to more visually see themedians to compare spending by different customer groups."
